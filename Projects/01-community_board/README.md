## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- One challenge I briefly ran into was having to export the const variable at the end of every .jsx file. I didn't have to do this previously using vanilla JS. Another challenge that was a bit more frustrating was getting the CSS just right like how I wanted it.
