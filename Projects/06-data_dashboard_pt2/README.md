# Web Development Project 6 - Brewery Finder

Submitted by: Bao Ngo

This web app: Utilizes the Open Brewery DB API to pull brewery information per user input. Users can enter a zipcode or brewery type they'd like to search for and the web app will output all the breweries within the given search parameter. The user will be able to click on a specific brewery and find out more information about it such as the address, phone number, website, brewery type, longtitude, latitude (location). The website button will take the user to that brewery's website and the call button will allow the user to call the brewery. All information is fetched using the Open Brewery API.
